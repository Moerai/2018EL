PROJECT ABLE(Always Bicycle LifE)

Bicycle are a great exercise. However, bicycles are sometimes dangerous because they ride outdoor and it is difficult to exercise constantly because of the weather. So we make a bicycle that can ride inside and outside safely. With Arduino, RaspberryPI and VR, you can enjoy your bike anytime and anywhere.

You can ride your bike indoors with VR and rollers. Arduino's read switch sensor and pressure sensor deliver the state of the bike to VR. Outdoors, you will use matrix LED and bar LED turn on your turnsignal lights so you can ride your bike more safely. In addition, it will replace the smart phone which gives unnecessary information of bicycle, ring LED for navigation, OLED to display speed, time, group riding information, heart rating and etc... you can also turn on and off with fingerprint recognition in preparation for bike theft.
