PROJECT ABLE(Always Bicycle LifE)

Cycling is a great exercise. However, riding byclces outdoor is sometimes dangerous and difficult due to a bad weather or lack of bike lanes. We make a bicycle which people can ride both indoor and outdoor safely. With Arduino, RaspberryPI and VR, you can enjoy cycling anytime, anywhere.

When indoors, you can ride your bike using VR and rollers. Arduino's read switch sensor and pressure sensor deliver the state of the bike to VR. When outdoors, you will use matrix LEDs and bar LEDs to turn on your turn signal lights, so that you can ride more safely. In addition, this can replace smart phone applications, which provide unncessary information about bicycles, as ring LEDs and OLEDs can navigate or display speed, time, group riding information, heart rating etc. You can also turn on and off your bike with fingerprint recognition, preventing bike thefts.

Thank you for your interest in our project.


This project is owned by the club EL of Dongyang Mirae University.
