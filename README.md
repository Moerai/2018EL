PROJECT ABLE(Always Bicycle LifE)
=============================

Cycling is a great exercise. However, riding byclces outdoor is sometimes dangerous and difficult due to a bad weather or lack of bike infrastructures. Our project starts to solve those problems. We make a smart bicycle kit which can be equipped on a bicycle and let people can ride it both indoor and outdoor safely. With our kit incorporates Arduino, Raspberry Pi and VR, you can enjoy cycling anytime, anywhere.

When indoors, you can ride your bike fixed by rollers using VR. A lead switch and a pressure seonsor of Arduino deliver state of the bike to VR. When outdoors, you can use matrix LEDs and bar LEDs to use turn signal lights, so that you can ride more safely. In addition, this can replace smart phone applications, which provide unncessary information about bicycles, as ring LEDs and OLEDs can navigate or display speed, time, group riding information, heart rating etc. You can also prevent bike thefts by turning on and off your kit with fingerprint identification security system.
